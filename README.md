# Suicide-insights

Suicide is a global challenge with the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimating that there are over 700,000 suicides annually. This personal project used data from the WHO and Data Bank to uncover general insights and to determine if unemployment rates have a connection to suicide rates. The hypothesis that guided this project is: 'the higher the unemployment rate, the higher the suicide rate'. 

Using Python, exploratory analysis through visualisations were initially conducted to find connections in the data. Supervised (linear regression) and unsupervised (k-means clustering) machine learning were then employed to explore these connections deeper and uncover further patterns to test the hypothesis.

The initial and final data frames used can be found in the 'Data' folder above.
